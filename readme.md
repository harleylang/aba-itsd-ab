# Time Series Design Boilerplate for Applied Behavior Analysts

This repository provides examples of how to use the `R` programming language to plot a basic time series design.

Here is an example AB design produced by the file `graph-session-bx1.R`:

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome! In particular, this repo is in need of the following:
* [ ] Fully detailed instructions on how to get started with `R` and RStudio.
* [ ] Example graph: Multiple behaviors in each condition
* [ ] Example graph: Multiple conditions (e.g., ABAB; perhaps put in a different repository?)
* [ ] Example graph: Continuous x-axis
* [ ] Example graph: With optional legend.

If you create a new example graph, please sure to label the file according to its use case (e.g, `graph-session-bx1` refers to one behaviour, session-by-session).

Anything else you need help with? Please submit an issue.
